## Overview
This package implements a *fix femocs* command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  This fix can be employed to either do concurrent
coupling of MD with FE-based physics surrogates or on-the-fly
post-processing of atomic information to continuum fields.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/femocs.

This package uses an external library in lib/femocs which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS. See the lib/femocs/README.md for the 
instructions to build FEMOCS. See the LAMMPS manual for information 
on building LAMMPS with external libraries. The settings in the 
femocs/share/makefile.femocs file must be correct for LAMMPS to build 
correctly with this package installed.

The primary people who created this package are Mihkel Veske
(veskem at gmail.com) and Andreas Kyritsakis (akyritsos1 at gmail.com).

## Citing
[FEMOCS](https://github.com/veskem/femocs/) is an open-source and freely available code. The details about its algorithms are published in
[Journal of Computational Physics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.04.031). When publishing results
obtained with the help of FEMOCS, please cite

## Instructions to build AtC library
Below are the instructions for building AtC library that is similar yet
different to FEMOCS.  
  
To use AtC, first compile it as a library. Use the same compiler as for building lammps.
Command make ubuntu is using mpic++ (see lammps/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.ubuntu). Therefore
  cd lammps/lib/atc
  make -f Makefile.mpic++
  
After this there should be libatc.a and Makefile.lammps in atc directory. The last must be altered:
  
    $ rm Makefile.lammps
    $ cp Makefile.lammps.installed Makefile.lammps

For further details, see lammps/lib/atc/README

To use libatc.a in LAMMPS, do

    $ cd lammps/src
    $ make yes-user-atc
    $ make yes-manybody
    $ make -j8 ubuntu      # uses 8 CPU cores to speed up compilation
  
## Miscellanneous notes
To get an idea of changing the forces, see src/fix_setforce.cpp/h

To use the code that is in USER-MISC, first copy *.cpp and *.h files there. After this
 
    $ cd lammps/src
    $ make yes-user-misc
    $ make -j8 ubuntu
